Description:

A machine learning model to predict AI Generated Text

This project utilizes Python as the primary programming language and leverages various libraries and tools to achieve its goals.

Installation Instructions:

Installing Python
To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Here are the steps:

Windows:
Download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Follow the installation instructions provided by the installer.

Mac (via Homebrew):
Install Homebrew if you haven't already: https://brew.sh/
Run `brew install python` to install Python.

Linux:
Check your distribution's package manager for a Python package (e.g., apt-get, yum, etc.)
Install the latest version of Python using your distribution's package manager.

Setting up a Virtual Environment (venv)
We recommend using a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated from the rest of your system. Here are the steps:
- Open Terminal.
- Run python -m venv myenv (replace myenv with your desired environment name).
- Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows, run `.\myenv\Scripts\activate`
    - On Mac/Linux, run `source myenv/bin/activate`
- Installing Requirements - This will install all the necessary libraries and tools for this project.
    - Once you've activated the virtual environment, install the required dependencies by running:
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`


Getting Started:

Now that you have Python installed and a virtual environment set up, navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt and run python main.py (or whatever script is specified in the project) to get started!

Note: This README assumes you're familiar with basic Python concepts. If you're new to Python, we recommend starting with some introductory tutorials before diving into this project.
